# WGU Portfolio

This is a portfolio of my work in the MS Data Analysis (MSDA) degree programs at Western Governors University. I am completing my education to make a career change into data science, and this portfolio showcases that work for prospective employers, while also providing useful resources for other students following behind me in those programs. [Why am I doing this?]

## Classes, Projects, Presentations, and Reviews
The below table contains all the work performed for my MSDA (graduated MMM YYYY). Employers will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Summary" links to get descriptions of a class, its requisite projects, and summaries of how I completed them, including links to those materials. Students will find the most use from clicking on the "Class Writeup" links to read my posts from the WGU_MSDA subreddit where I covered my experiences with each class, including stumbling blocks, useful resources, etc. Links directly to reports, video presentations, etc. are also directly available in the table.
